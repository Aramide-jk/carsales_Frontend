              <h3>A Legacy of Luxury</h3>
              <p>
                Founded in 2019 with a vision to redefine the luxury car buying
                experience, SK_Leeno began as a boutique dealership focused on
                curating exceptional vehicles for exceptional people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our founder's passion for automotive excellence and commitment
                to customer satisfaction laid the foundation for what has become
                a trusted name in luxury vehicle sales.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we continue to uphold those founding principles while
                embracing innovation and expanding our reach to serve luxury car
                enthusiasts worldwide.
